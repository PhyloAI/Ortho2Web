**Ortho2Web: A workflow for disentangling Hybrization and Allopolyploidization using multi-source genomic data**

Ortho2Web was developed to provide a comprehensive framework for disentangling the complex processes of hybridization and allopolyploidization, which are critical for understanding the evolution of reticulate lineages. These processes play key roles in generating genetic diversity and driving speciation, yet they are notoriously difficult to differentiate using traditional methods, which often rely on analyzing individual data types in isolation. By integrating maternally inherited plastome data with biparentally inherited nuclear data, Ortho2Web overcomes these limitations. It leverages multi-source genomic data to perform phylogenomic conflict and historical biogeographic analyses, enabling the reconstruction of detailed evolutionary scenarios, both ancient and recent.
